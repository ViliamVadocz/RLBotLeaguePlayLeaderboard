# Automatic League Play Leaderboard Generator

User guide:

- Download this repo.
- Make sure main.py is in the same directory as the Leaderboard_empty.png, the font .tff file, and the two txt files with the standings.
- Copy and paste the previous week's and current week's standings in the previous_week.txt and current_week.txt files.
    - The bot names should be seperated by new lines. You should be able to just copy and paste them directly from Google sheets.
- Run main.py

I still have some features I want to add, so stay tuned.

Feel free to leave feedback. Enjoy!
